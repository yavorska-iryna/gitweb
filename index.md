## About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Wehr lab, University of Oregon studying the role of inhibitory interneurons in processing sound.  

## Research
My research focuses on understanding diverse neuronal populations make up local cortical circuits
* three main subclasses on inhibitory neurons
* effects of endogenous modulation on cortical processing


## Functional diversity of inhibitory interneurons

## Global vs local neural processing

## Why sensory neuroscience?
